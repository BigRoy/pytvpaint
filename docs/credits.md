## Credits

- The [George commands documentation](https://www.tvpaint.com/doc/tvpaint-animation-11/george-commands) from TVPaint.

- The [Pydantic documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev) was a great inspiration 💅.

- The C++ plugin was made possible with the already existing codebase of Ynput's [OpenPype TVPaint plugin](https://github.com/ynput/OpenPype/tree/develop/openpype/hosts/tvpaint/tvpaint_plugin/plugin_code).

- Also thanks to [Jakub Trllo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakub-trllo-751387a6/) from Ynput who helped with the C++ implementation on their Discord server 🙏.

    Great things happen when open-source builds on open-source that builds on open-source!
